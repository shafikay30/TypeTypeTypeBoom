						<header><h2>A Brief Introduction About Tamil Alphabet</h2></header>
						<p>
							Tamil is a Dravidian language spoken mainly in southern India and Sri Lanka, and also in Malaysia, the UK, South Africa, Canada, the USA, Singapore, France, Mauritius, and many other countries.
							<br>
							In Tamil, there are 247 characters. The Tamil alphabet has 12 vowels and 18 consonants. These combine to form 216 compound characters. There is one special character (Aaytha ezutthu), giving a total of 247 characters.
							<br>The vowels are divided into short and long (five of each type) and two dipthongs. The consonants are classified into three categories with 6 in each category: vallinam - hard, mellinam - soft or nasal, and idayinam - medium. Unlike Devanagari, Tamil has neither conjunct consonants nor aspirated and voiced stops. Some scholars have suggested that in Sentamil (which refers to Tamil as it existed before Sanskrit words were borrowed), stops were voiceless when at the start of a word and unvoiced otherwise. However, no such distinction is observed by modern Tamil speakers.</p>
